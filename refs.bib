  abstract  = {One of the major methods to identify microbial community
               composition, to unravel microbial population dynamics, and to
               explore microbial diversity in environmental samples is
               high-throughput DNA- or RNA-based 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon
               sequencing in combination with bioinformatics analyses. However,
               focusing on environmental samples from contrasting habitats, it
               was not systematically evaluated (i) which analysis methods
               provide results that reflect reality most accurately, (ii) how
               the interpretations of microbial community studies are biased by
               different analysis methods and (iii) if the most optimal analysis
               workflow can be implemented in an easy-to-use pipeline. Here, we
               compared the performance of 16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequencing
               analysis tools (i.e., Mothur, QIIME1, QIIME2, and MEGAN) using
               three mock datasets with known microbial community composition
               that differed in sequencing quality, species number and abundance
               distribution (i.e., even or uneven), and phylogenetic diversity
               (i.e., closely related or well-separated amplicon sequences). Our
               results showed that QIIME2 outcompeted all other investigated
               tools in sequence recovery (>10 times fewer false positives),
               taxonomic assignments (>22\% better F-score) and diversity
               estimates (>5\% better assessment), suggesting that this approach
               is able to reflect the in situ microbial community most
               accurately. Further analysis of 24 environmental datasets
               obtained from four contrasting terrestrial and freshwater sites
               revealed dramatic differences in the resulting microbial
               community composition for all pipelines at genus level. For
               instance, at the investigated river water sites Sphaerotilus was
               only reported when using QIIME1 (8\% abundance) and Agitococcus
               with QIIME1 or QIIME2 (2 or 3\% abundance, respectively), but
               both genera remained undetected when analyzed with Mothur or
               MEGAN. Since these abundant taxa probably have implications for
               important biogeochemical cycles (e.g., nitrate and sulfate
               reduction) at these sites, their detection and semi-quantitative
               enumeration is crucial for valid interpretations. A
               high-performance computing conformant workflow was constructed to
               allow FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable)
               16S rRNA (gene) amplicon sequence analysis starting from raw
               sequence files, using the most optimal methods identified in our
               study. Our presented workflow should be considered for future
               studies, thereby facilitating the analysis of high-throughput 16S
               rRNA (gene) sequencing data substantially, while maximizing
               reliability and confidence in microbial community data analysis.},

              culture in the laboratory, which can confound cataloging of

  abstract = {Although microbial communities are associated with human,
              environmental, plant, and animal health, there exists no
              cost-effective method for precisely characterizing species and
              genes in such communities. While deep whole-metagenome shotgun
              (WMS) sequencing provides high taxonomic and functional
              resolution, it is often prohibitively expensive for large-scale
              studies. The prevailing alternative, 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S)
              sequencing, often does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level
              and provides only moderately accurate predictions of the
              functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted
              approach to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic, and functional
              microbiome analysis. To address this technology gap, we evaluated
              the information content of shallow shotgun sequencing with as low
              as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an alternative to 16S
              sequencing for large human microbiome studies. We describe a
              library preparation protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing
              at approximately the same per-sample cost as 16S sequencing. We
              analyzed multiple real and simulated biological data sets,
              including two novel human stool samples with ultradeep sequencing
              of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, and found that shallow
              shotgun sequencing recovers more-accurate species-level taxonomic
              and functional profiles of the human microbiome than 16S
              sequencing. We discuss the inherent limitations of shallow shotgun
              sequencing and note that 16S sequencing remains a valuable and
              important method for taxonomic profiling of novel environments.
              Although deep WMS sequencing remains the gold standard for
              high-resolution microbiome analysis, we recommend that researchers
              consider shallow shotgun sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S
              sequencing for large-scale human microbiome research studies where
              WMS sequencing may be cost-prohibitive. IMPORTANCE A common
              refrain in recent microbiome-related academic meetings is that the
              field needs to move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S
              sequencing and toward more powerful longitudinal studies using
              shotgun sequencing. However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in
              large longitudinal studies remains prohibitively expensive for all
              but the most well-funded research labs and consortia, which leads
              many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for large studies,
              followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted
              samples. Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun
              sequencing may be used by researchers to obtain species-level
              taxonomic and functional data at approximately the same cost as
              amplicon sequencing. While shallow shotgun sequencing is not
              intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level
              characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists consider
              using shallow shotgun sequencing instead of 16S sequencing for
              large-scale human microbiome studies.},

               communities using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Identification
               of the microorganisms in a sample provides information about the
               genetic profile, population structure, and role of microorganisms
               within an environment. Until recently, most metagenomics studies
               focused on high-level characterization at the level of phyla, or
               alternatively sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA gene that is
               present in bacterial species. As the cost of sequencing has
               fallen, though, metagenomics experiments have increasingly used
               unbiased shotgun sequencing to capture all the organisms in a
               sample. This approach requires a method for estimating abundance
               directly from the raw read data. Here we describe a fast,
               accurate new method that computes the abundance at the species
               level using the reads collected in a metagenomics experiment.
               Bracken (Bayesian Reestimation of Abundance after Classification
               with KrakEN) uses the taxonomic assignments made by Kraken, a
               very fast read-level classifier, along with information about the
               genomes themselves to estimate abundance at the species level,
               the genus level, or above. We demonstrate that Bracken can
               produce accurate species- and genus-level abundance estimates
               even when a sample contains multiple near-identical species.},

              Through the introduction of a new metagenomic analysis tool called

              While recent taxonomic classification programs achieve high speed
              by comparing genomic k-mers, they often lack sensitivity for
              overcoming evolutionary divergence, so that large fractions of the

              metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact
              matches on the protein-level using the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
              We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies

              abundance of microorganisms in biological samples. Available
              methods using shotgun metagenomic data generally depend on the
              deposition of sequenced and taxonomically annotated genomes,
              usually from cultures of isolated strains, in reference databases
              (reference genomes). However, the majority of microorganisms have
              not been cultured yet. Thus, a substantial fraction of microbial
              community members remains unaccounted for during taxonomic
              profiling, particularly in samples from underexplored
              environments. To address this issue, we developed the mOTU
              profiler, a tool that enables reference genome-independent
              species-level profiling of metagenomes. As such, it supports the
              identification and quantification of both ``known'' and
              ``unknown'' species based on a set of select marker genes.
              RESULTS: We present mOTUs3, a command line tool that enables the
              profiling of metagenomes for >33,000 species-level operational
              taxonomic units. To achieve this, we leveraged the reconstruction
              of >600,000 draft genomes, most of which are metagenome-assembled
              genomes (MAGs), from diverse microbiomes, including soil,
              freshwater systems, and the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants
              and other animals, which we found to be underrepresented by
              reference genomes. Overall, two thirds of all species-level taxa
              lacked a reference genome. The cumulative relative abundance of
              these newly included taxa was low in well-studied microbiomes,
              such as the human body sites (6-11\%). By contrast, they accounted
              for substantial proportions (ocean, freshwater, soil: 43-63\%) or
              even the majority (pig, fish, cattle: 60-80\%) of the relative
              abundance across diverse non-human-associated microbiomes. Using
              community-developed benchmarks and datasets, we found mOTUs3 to be
              more accurate than other methods and to be more congruent with 16S
              rRNA gene-based methods for taxonomic profiling. Furthermore, we
              demonstrate that mOTUs3 increases the resolution of well-known
              microbial groups into species-level taxa and helps identify new
              differentially abundant taxa in comparative metagenomic studies.
              CONCLUSIONS: We developed mOTUs3 to enable accurate species-level
              profiling of metagenomes. Compared to other methods, it provides a
              more comprehensive view of prokaryotic community diversity, in
              particular for currently underexplored microbiomes. To facilitate

              lacked a reference genome. The cumulative relative abundance of
              these newly included taxa was low in well-studied microbiomes,
              such as the human body sites (6-11\%). By contrast, they accounted
              for substantial proportions (ocean, freshwater, soil: 43-63\%) or
              even the majority (pig, fish, cattle: 60-80\%) of the relative
              abundance across diverse non-human-associated microbiomes. Using
              community-developed benchmarks and datasets, we found mOTUs3 to be
              more accurate than other methods and to be more congruent with 16S
              rRNA gene-based methods for taxonomic profiling. Furthermore, we
              demonstrate that mOTUs3 increases the resolution of well-known
              microbial groups into species-level taxa and helps identify new
              differentially abundant taxa in comparative metagenomic studies.
              CONCLUSIONS: We developed mOTUs3 to enable accurate species-level
              profiling of metagenomes. Compared to other methods, it provides a
              more comprehensive view of prokaryotic community diversity, in
              particular for currently underexplored microbiomes. To facilitate
              comparative analyses by the research community, it is released
              with >11,000 precomputed profiles for publicly available
              metagenomes and is freely available at:

               greatly benefits metagenomics studies. However, currently
               available methods struggle to manage the increasing amount of
               sequences and their frequent updates. Indexing the current RefSeq
               can take days and hundreds of GB of memory on large servers. Few
               methods address these issues thus far, and even though many can
               theoretically handle large amounts of references, time/memory
               requirements are prohibitive in practice. As a result, many
               studies that require sequence classification use often outdated
               and almost never truly up-to-date indices. RESULTS: Motivated by
               those limitations, we created ganon, a k-mer-based read
               classification tool that uses Interleaved Bloom Filters in
               conjunction with a taxonomic clustering and a k-mer
               counting/filtering scheme. Ganon provides an efficient method for
               indexing references, keeping them updated. It requires <55 min to
               index the complete RefSeq of bacteria, archaea, fungi and
               viruses. The tool can further keep these indices up-to-date in a
               fraction of the time necessary to create them. Ganon makes it
               possible to query against very large reference sets and therefore
               it classifies significantly more reads and identifies more
               species than similar methods. When classifying a high-complexity
               CAMI challenge dataset against complete genomes from RefSeq,
               ganon shows strongly increased precision with equal or better
               sensitivity compared with state-of-the-art tools. With the same
               dataset against the complete RefSeq, ganon improved the F1-score
               by 65\% at the genus level. It supports taxonomy- and
               assembly-level classification, multiple indices and hierarchical
               classification. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is

               RESULTS: We present KMCP (K-mer-based Metagenomic Classification
               and Profiling), a novel k-mer-based metagenomic profiling tool
               that utilizes genome coverage information by splitting the

              Shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing is a relatively new and
              powerful environmental sequencing approach that provides insight
              into community biodiversity and function. But, the analysis of
              metagenomic sequences is complicated due to the complex structure

              to determine which microbes are present in the community and what

              strategies and specific tools that can be applied to metagenomic
              data and the considerations and caveats associated with their use.

              quantify community structure and diversity, assemble novel
              genomes, identify new taxa and genes, and determine which

               direct read shotgun metagenomics taxonomic profiling software to
               characterize the microbial compositions of simulated mice gut
               microbiome samples and of biological samples collected from wild
               rodents across multiple taxonomic levels. Using ten of the most
               widely used metagenomics software and four different databases,
               we demonstrated that obtaining an accurate species-level
               microbial profile using the current direct read metagenomics
               profiling software is still a challenging task. We also showed
               that the discrepancies in results when different databases and

               distinct microbial taxa classified, in the characterizations of
               the microbial communities, and in the differentially abundant

               the interested taxa in the databases is important for increasing
               the accuracy of profiling. Our analysis also showed that software

               has the potential to provide rapid and precise real-time
               diagnostic results. However, it is potentially limited by
               sequencing and taxonomic classification errors. We use simulated
               and real-world data to benchmark rates of species
               misclassification using 100 reference genomes for each of the ten
               common bloodstream pathogens and six frequent blood-culture
               contaminants (n=1568, only 68 genomes were available for
               Micrococcus luteus). Simulating both with and without sequencing
               error for both the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms, we
               evaluated commonly used classification tools including Kraken2,
               Bracken and Centrifuge, utilizing mini (8 GB) and standard (30-50
               GB) databases. Bracken with the standard database performed best,
               the median percentage of reads across both sequencing platforms
               identified correctly to the species level was 97.8\% (IQR
               92.7:99.0) [range 5:100]. For Kraken2 with a mini database, a
               commonly used combination, median species-level identification
               was 86.4\% (IQR 50.5:93.7) [range 4.3:100]. Classification
               performance varied by species, with Escherichia coli being more
               challenging to classify correctly (probability of reads being
               assigned to the correct species: 56.1-96.0\%, varying by tool
               used). Human read misclassification was negligible. By filtering
               out shorter Nanopore reads we found performance similar or
               superior to Illumina sequencing, despite higher sequencing error
               rates. Misclassification was more common when the misclassified
               species had a higher average nucleotide identity to the true
               species. Our findings highlight taxonomic misclassification of
               sequencing data occurs and varies by sequencing and analysis
               workflow. To account for 'bioinformatic contamination' we present
               a contamination catalogue that can be used in metagenomic
               pipelines to ensure accurate results that can support clinical
               decision making.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the main challenges in metagenomics is the
              identification of microorganisms in clinical and environmental
              samples. While an extensive and heterogeneous set of computational
              tools is available to classify microorganisms using whole-genome
              shotgun sequencing data, comprehensive comparisons of these
              methods are limited. RESULTS: In this study, we use the
              largest-to-date set of laboratory-generated and simulated controls
              across 846 species to evaluate the performance of 11 metagenomic
              classifiers. Tools were characterized on the basis of their
              ability to identify taxa at the genus, species, and strain levels,
              quantify relative abundances of taxa, and classify individual
              reads to the species level. Strikingly, the number of species
              identified by the 11 tools can differ by over three orders of
              magnitude on the same datasets. Various strategies can ameliorate
              taxonomic misclassification, including abundance filtering,
              ensemble approaches, and tool intersection. Nevertheless, these
              strategies were often insufficient to completely eliminate false
              positives from environmental samples, which are especially
              important where they concern medically relevant species. Overall,
              pairing tools with different classification strategies (k-mer,
              alignment, marker) can combine their respective advantages.
              CONCLUSIONS: This study provides positive and negative controls,
              titrated standards, and a guide for selecting tools for
              metagenomic analyses by comparing ranges of precision, accuracy,
              and recall. We show that proper experimental design and analysis
              parameters can reduce false positives, provide greater resolution
              of species in complex metagenomic samples, and improve the
              interpretation of results.},

               usually the taxonomic classification of reads by comparison to a
               database of previously taxonomically classified genomes. While
               different studies comparing metagenomic taxonomic classification
               methods have determined that different tools are 'best', there
               are two tools that have been used the most to-date: Kraken
               (k-mer-based classification against a user-constructed database)
               and MetaPhlAn (classification by alignment to clade-specific
               marker genes), the latest versions of which are Kraken2 and
               MetaPhlAn 3, respectively. We found large discrepancies in both
               the proportion of reads that were classified as well as the
               number of species that were identified when we used both Kraken2
               and MetaPhlAn 3 to classify reads within metagenomes from
               human-associated or environmental datasets. We then investigated
               which of these tools would give classifications closest to the
               real composition of metagenomic samples using a range of
               simulated and mock samples and examined the combined impact of
               tool-parameter-database choice on the taxonomic classifications
               given. This revealed that there may not be a one-size-fits-all
               'best' choice. While Kraken2 can achieve better overall
               performance, with higher precision, recall and F1 scores, as well
               as alpha- and beta-diversity measures closer to the known
               composition than MetaPhlAn 3, the computational resources
               required for this may be prohibitive for many researchers, and
               the default database and parameters should not be used. We
               therefore conclude that the best tool-parameter-database choice
               for a particular application depends on the scientific question
               of interest, which performance metric is most important for this
               question and the limit of available computational resources.},

               platform independent executable environments for bioinformatics
               software. BioContainers allows labs of all sizes to easily
               install bioinformatics software, maintain multiple versions of
               the same software and combine tools into powerful analysis
               pipelines. BioContainers is based on popular open-source projects
               Docker and rkt frameworks, that allow software to be installed
               and executed under an isolated and controlled environment. Also,
               it provides infrastructure and basic guidelines to create, manage
               and distribute bioinformatics containers with a special focus on
               omics technologies. These containers can be integrated into more
               comprehensive bioinformatics pipelines and different
               architectures (local desktop, cloud environments or HPC

               providing clean data for downstream analysis. Traditionally, a
               different tool is used for each operation, such as quality
               control, adapter trimming and quality filtering. These tools are
               often insufficiently fast as most are developed using high-level

              and longer reads, sequences generated from short inserts, such as
              those obtained from fossil and degraded material, are increasingly
              expected to contain adapter sequences. Efficient adapter trimming
              algorithms are also needed to process the growing amount of data
              generated per sequencing run. FINDINGS: We introduce
              AdapterRemoval v2, a major revision of AdapterRemoval v1, which
              introduces (i) striking improvements in throughput, through the
              use of single instruction, multiple data (SIMD; SSE1 and SSE2)
              instructions and multi-threading support, (ii) the ability to
              handle datasets containing reads or read-pairs with different
              adapters or adapter pairs, (iii) simultaneous demultiplexing and
              adapter trimming, (iv) the ability to reconstruct adapter
              sequences from paired-end reads for poorly documented data sets,
              and (v) native gzip and bzip2 support. CONCLUSIONS: We show that
              AdapterRemoval v2 compares favorably with existing tools, while
              offering superior throughput to most alternatives examined here,
              both for single and multi-threaded operations.},

              whole genome sequencing. While Illumina data is appropriate for
              many analyses, its short read length limits its ability to resolve
              genomic structure. This has major implications for tracking the
              spread of mobile genetic elements, including those which carry
              antimicrobial resistance determinants. Fully resolving a bacterial
              genome requires long-read sequencing such as those generated by
              Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Here we describe our
              use of the ONT MinION to sequence 12 isolates of Klebsiella
              pneumoniae on a single flow cell. We assembled each genome using a
              combination of ONT reads and previously available Illumina reads,
              and little to no manual intervention was needed to achieve fully
              resolved assemblies using the Unicycler hybrid assembler.
              Assembling only ONT reads with Canu was less effective, resulting
              in fewer resolved genomes and higher error rates even following
              error correction with Nanopolish. We demonstrate that multiplexed
              ONT sequencing is a valuable tool for high-throughput bacterial
              genome finishing. Specifically, we advocate the use of Illumina
              sequencing as a first analysis step, followed by ONT reads as
              needed to resolve genomic structure.},

              sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp)
              produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in

              format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are
              released. SAMtools implements various utilities for
              post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing,
              variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: A critical output of metagenomic studies is the
               estimation of abundances of taxonomical or functional groups. The
               inherent uncertainty in assignments to these groups makes it
               important to consider both their hierarchical contexts and their
               prediction confidence. The current tools for visualizing
               metagenomic data, however, omit or distort quantitative
               hierarchical relationships and lack the facility for displaying
               secondary variables. RESULTS: Here we present Krona, a new
               visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative
               abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of
               metagenomic classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial,
               space-filling displays with parametric coloring and interactive
               polar-coordinate zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation
               enables fully interactive charts that can be explored with any
               modern Web browser, without the need for installed software or
               plug-ins. This Web-based architecture also allows each chart to
               be an independent document, making them easy to share via e-mail
               or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate Krona's utility,
               we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and
               its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis tools.
               CONCLUSIONS: Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization
               tool and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly
               accessible bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive
               displays facilitate more informed interpretations of metagenomic
               analyses, while its implementation as a browser-based application
               makes it extremely portable and easily adopted into existing
               analysis packages. Both the Krona rendering code and conversion
               tools are freely available under a BSD open-source license, and

              or genus-level identification, but also the large subunit (LSU;
              23S/28S) rRNA gene is employed in taxonomic assignment. The METAXA

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Long-read shotgun metagenomic sequencing is gaining
               in popularity and offers many advantages over short-read
               sequencing. The higher information content in long reads is
               useful for a variety of metagenomics analyses, including
               taxonomic classification and profiling. The development of
               long-read specific tools for taxonomic classification is
               accelerating, yet there is a lack of information regarding their
               relative performance. Here, we perform a critical benchmarking
               study using 11 methods, including five methods designed
               specifically for long reads. We applied these tools to several
               mock community datasets generated using Pacific Biosciences
               (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing, and
               evaluated their performance based on read utilization, detection
               metrics, and relative abundance estimates. RESULTS: Our results
               show that long-read classifiers generally performed best. Several
               short-read classification and profiling methods produced many
               false positives (particularly at lower abundances), required
               heavy filtering to achieve acceptable precision (at the cost of
               reduced recall), and produced inaccurate abundance estimates. By
               contrast, two long-read methods (BugSeq, MEGAN-LR \& DIAMOND) and
               one generalized method (sourmash) displayed high precision and
               recall without any filtering required. Furthermore, in the PacBio
               HiFi datasets these methods detected all species down to the
               0.1\% abundance level with high precision. Some long-read
               methods, such as MetaMaps and MMseqs2, required moderate
               filtering to reduce false positives to resemble the precision and
               recall of the top-performing methods. We found read quality
               affected performance for methods relying on protein prediction or
               exact k-mer matching, and these methods performed better with
               PacBio HiFi datasets. We also found that long-read datasets with
               a large proportion of shorter reads (< 2 kb length) resulted in
               lower precision and worse abundance estimates, relative to
               length-filtered datasets. Finally, for classification methods, we
               found that the long-read datasets produced significantly better
               results than short-read datasets, demonstrating clear advantages
               for long-read metagenomic sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Our critical
               assessment of available methods provides best-practice
               recommendations for current research using long reads and
               establishes a baseline for future benchmarking studies.},

               (or did) contain vectors. The National Center for Biotechnology
               Information uses the program VecScreen to screen submitted
               sequences for contamination. Additional tools are needed to
               distinguish true-positive (contamination) from false-positive
               (not contamination) VecScreen matches. Results: A principal
               reason for false-positive VecScreen matches is that the sequence
               and the matching vector subsequence originate from closely
               related or identical organisms (for example, both originate in
               Escherichia coli). We collected information on the taxonomy of
               sources of vector segments in the UniVec database used by
               VecScreen. We used that information in two overlapping software
               pipelines for retrospective analysis of contamination in GenBank
               and for prospective analysis of contamination in new sequence
               submissions. Using the retrospective pipeline, we identified and
               corrected over 8000 contaminated sequences in the nonredundant

              RESULTS: We present a modular and user-extensible pipeline called

              scan of complete and draft bacterial and archaeal genomes in the
              NCBI RefSeq database reveals that 2250 genomes are contaminated by
              human sequence. The contaminant sequences derive primarily from
              high-copy human repeat regions, which themselves are not
              adequately represented in the current human reference genome,
              GRCh38. The absence of the sequences from the human assembly
              offers a likely explanation for their presence in bacterial
              assemblies. In some cases, the contaminating contigs have been
              erroneously annotated as containing protein-coding sequences,
              which over time have propagated to create spurious protein
              ``families'' across multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes.
              As a result, 3437 spurious protein entries are currently present
              in the widely-used nr and TrEMBL protein databases. We report here
              an extensive list of contaminant sequences in bacterial genome

               removal of several main workflow sections, specifically all
               antibiotic resistance gene tools and the assembly workflow have
               been removed. Users interested in AMR profiling should consider
               using the BBMap or Bowtie2-based mapping workflows in StaG, or
               turn to another Snakemake or Nextflow workflow for that type of
               profiling (e.g. the latest AMR++ release). This StaG release also
               adds a new feature: host removal using Bowtie2, intended to be
               used for high-host microbiome samples in combination with Kraken2
               because it is very sensitive to remaining host contamination left
               behind after kraken2 host removal. We find that if performing
               taxonomic profiling with MetaPhlAn4 the quality of host removal
               has no substantial impact on the quality of the taxonomic
               profiles and users can benefit from continuing to use Kraken2 for
               host removal to save some time and compute resources in those
               cases. In addition, there is a critical bug fix when running
               HUMAnN3 that all users should upgrade to. The previous StaG
               release, v0.6.1 was two weeks ago. The v0.7.0 release modifies
               approximately 35 files and removes approximately 1472 lines of
               code, with 381 new lines. [0.7.0] 2023-06-13 Added Host removal:
               Bowtie2 now available as an option for host removal. \#\#\#\#
               Fixed HUMAnN3: Fixed critical bug leading to entire system-wide
               temporary directory being emptied after successful HUMAnN run.
               Singularity: All Singularity definition files should from now on
               get version bumps in the description labels when conda
               environments built inside them are updated to reduce the risk of
               Singularity reusing old cached copies of images instead of
               download the latest version. \#\#\#\# Changed Preprocessing
               summary: Preprocessing summary script can now output a table of
               read counts regardless of which combination of read QC and host
               removal is used. \#\#\#\# Removed AMR++, Groot: All tools for
               antibiotic resistance gene profiling have been removed entirely
               because they were out of date and had few active users. Users
               wanting to perform antibiotic resistance gene profiling are
               suggested to use the mapper modules with a suitable reference
               database or run the latest version of AMR++ separately. Assembly:

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Microorganisms are important occupants of many
               different environments. Identifying the composition of microbes
               and estimating their abundance promote understanding of
               interactions of microbes in environmental samples. To understand
               their environments more deeply, the composition of microorganisms
               in environmental samples has been studied using metagenomes,
               which are the collections of genomes of the microorganisms.
               Although many tools have been developed for taxonomy analysis
               based on different algorithms, variability of analysis outputs of
               existing tools from the same input metagenome datasets is the
               main obstacle for many researchers in this field. RESULTS: Here,
               we present a novel meta-analysis tool for metagenome taxonomy
               analysis, called TAMA, by intelligently integrating outputs from
               three different taxonomy analysis tools. Using an integrated
               reference database, TAMA performs taxonomy assignment for input
               metagenome reads based on a meta-score by integrating scores of
               taxonomy assignment from different taxonomy classification tools.
               TAMA outperformed existing tools when evaluated using various
               benchmark datasets. It was also successfully applied to obtain
               relative species abundance profiles and difference in composition
               of microorganisms in two types of cheese metagenome and human gut
               metagenome. CONCLUSION: TAMA can be easily installed and used for
               metagenome read classification and the prediction of relative
               species abundance from multiple numbers and types of metagenome
               read samples. TAMA can be used to more accurately uncover the
               composition of microorganisms in metagenome samples collected
               from various environments, especially when the use of a single
               taxonomy analysis tool is unreliable. TAMA is an open source
               tool, and can be downloaded at https://github.com/jkimlab/TAMA.},

               biomedical research. With the increasing amount and complexity of
               data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not
               just for experiments, but also for computational analysis.
               However, transforming data into information involves running a
               large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating
               dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were
               developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline
               development, optimize resource usage, handle software
               installation and versions, and run on different compute
               platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this
               Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers,
               compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows,
               and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users.
               We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable
               novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice
               analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum,

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Metagenome shotgun sequencing presents opportunities
               to identify organisms that may prevent or promote disease. The
               analysis of sample diversity is achieved by taxonomic
               identification of metagenomic reads followed by generating an
               abundance profile. Numerous tools have been developed based on
               different design principles. Tools achieving high precision can
               lack sensitivity in some applications. Conversely, tools with
               high sensitivity can suffer from low precision and require long
               computation time. METHODS: In this paper, we present WEVOTE
               (WEighted VOting Taxonomic idEntification), a method that
               classifies metagenome shotgun sequencing DNA reads based on an
               ensemble of existing methods using k-mer-based, marker-based, and
               naive-similarity based approaches. Our evaluation on fourteen
               benchmarking datasets shows that WEVOTE improves the
               classification precision by reducing false positive annotations
               while preserving a high level of sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: WEVOTE
               is an efficient and automated tool that combines multiple
               individual taxonomic identification methods to produce more
               precise and sensitive microbial profiles. WEVOTE is developed
               primarily to identify reads generated by MetaGenome Shotgun
               sequencing. It is expandable and has the potential to incorporate
               additional tools to produce a more accurate taxonomic profile.

               shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of uncultivated microbial
               populations that may have important roles in their environments.
               Extracting individual draft genomes (bins) facilitates
               metagenomic analysis at the single genome level. Software and
               pipelines for such analysis have become diverse and
               sophisticated, resulting in a significant burden for biologists
               to access and use them. Furthermore, while bin extraction
               algorithms are rapidly improving, there is still a lack of tools
               for their evaluation and visualization. RESULTS: To address these
               challenges, we present metaWRAP, a modular pipeline software for
               shotgun metagenomic data analysis. MetaWRAP deploys
               state-of-the-art software to handle metagenomic data processing
               starting from raw sequencing reads and ending in metagenomic bins
               and their analysis. MetaWRAP is flexible enough to give
               investigators control over the analysis, while still being
               easy-to-install and easy-to-use. It includes hybrid algorithms
               that leverage the strengths of a variety of software to extract
               and refine high-quality bins from metagenomic data through bin
               consolidation and reassembly. MetaWRAP's hybrid bin extraction
               algorithm outperforms individual binning approaches and other bin
               consolidation programs in both synthetic and real data sets.
               Finally, metaWRAP comes with numerous modules for the analysis of
               metagenomic bins, including taxonomy assignment, abundance
               estimation, functional annotation, and visualization.
               CONCLUSIONS: MetaWRAP is an easy-to-use modular pipeline that
               automates the core tasks in metagenomic analysis, while
               contributing significant improvements to the extraction and
               interpretation of high-quality metagenomic bins. The bin
               refinement and reassembly modules of metaWRAP consistently
               outperform other binning approaches. Each module of metaWRAP is
               also a standalone component, making it a flexible and versatile
               tool for tackling metagenomic shotgun sequencing data. MetaWRAP

              data sets are affected, often to an unknown degree, by biases
              derived from insufficient coverage and reference
              database-dependent estimations of diversity. For instance, the
              completeness of reference databases cannot be generally estimated
              since it depends on the extant diversity sampled to date, which,
              with the exception of a few habitats such as the human gut,
              remains severely undersampled. Further, estimation of the degree
              of coverage of a microbial community by a metagenomic data set is
              prohibitively time-consuming for large data sets, and coverage
              values may not be directly comparable between data sets obtained
              with different sequencing technologies. Here, we extend Nonpareil,
              a database-independent tool for the estimation of coverage in
              metagenomic data sets, to a high-performance computing
              implementation that scales up to hundreds of cores and includes,
              in addition, a k-mer-based estimation as sensitive as the original
              alignment-based version but about three hundred times as fast.
              Further, we propose a metric of sequence diversity (N d ) derived
              directly from Nonpareil curves that correlates well with alpha
              diversity assessed by traditional metrics. We use this metric in
              different experiments demonstrating the correlation with the
              Shannon index estimated on 16S rRNA gene profiles and show that N
              d additionally reveals seasonal patterns in marine samples that
              are not captured by the Shannon index and more precise rankings of
              the magnitude of diversity of microbial communities in different
              habitats. Therefore, the new version of Nonpareil, called
              Nonpareil 3, advances the toolbox for metagenomic analyses of
              microbiomes. IMPORTANCE Estimation of the coverage provided by a
              metagenomic data set, i.e., what fraction of the microbial
              community was sampled by DNA sequencing, represents an essential
              first step of every culture-independent genomic study that aims to
              robustly assess the sequence diversity present in a sample.
              However, estimation of coverage remains elusive because of several
              technical limitations associated with high computational
              requirements and limiting statistical approaches to quantify
              diversity. Here we described Nonpareil 3, a new bioinformatics
              algorithm that circumvents several of these limitations and thus
              can facilitate culture-independent studies in clinical or
              environmental settings, independent of the sequencing platform
              employed. In addition, we present a new metric of sequence
              diversity based on rarefied coverage and demonstrate its use in
              communities from diverse ecosystems.},

               generalization of metagenomic sequencing, which has become a
               standard procedure for analyzing the structure and functionality
               of microbiomes. Bioinformatic analysis of sequencing results
               poses a challenge because it involves many different complex
               steps. SqueezeMeta is a fully automatic pipeline for
               metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, covering all steps of the
               analysis. SqueezeMeta includes multi-metagenome support that
               enables co-assembly of related metagenomes and retrieval of
               individual genomes via binning procedures. SqueezeMeta features
               several unique characteristics: co-assembly procedure or
               co-assembly of unlimited number of metagenomes via merging of
               individual assembled metagenomes, both with read mapping for
               estimation of the abundances of genes in each metagenome. It also
               includes binning and bin checking for retrieving individual
               genomes. Internal checks for the assembly and binning steps
               provide information about the consistency of contigs and bins.
               Moreover, results are stored in a MySQL database, where they can
               be easily exported and shared, and can be inspected anywhere
               using a flexible web interface that allows simple creation of
               complex queries. We illustrate the potential of SqueezeMeta by
               analyzing 32 gut metagenomes in a fully automatic way, enabling
               retrieval of several million genes and several hundreds of
               genomic bins. One of the motivations in the development of
               SqueezeMeta was producing a software capable of running in small
               desktop computers and thus amenable to all users and settings. We
               were also able to co-assemble two of these metagenomes and
               complete the full analysis in less than one day using a simple
               laptop computer. This reveals the capacity of SqueezeMeta to run
               without high-performance computing infrastructure and in absence
               of any network connectivity. It is therefore adequate for in

               As a complete metagenomic analysis requires different tools for
               different purposes, the selection and setup of these tools remain
               challenging. Furthermore, the chosen toolset will affect the
               accuracy, the formatting, and the functional identifiers reported
               in the results, impacting the results interpretation and the
               biological answer obtained. Thus, we surveyed state-of-the-art
               tools available in the literature, created simulated datasets,
               and performed benchmarks to design a sensitive and flexible
               metagenomic analysis pipeline. Here we present MEDUSA, an
               efficient pipeline to conduct comprehensive metagenomic analyses.
               It performs preprocessing, assembly, alignment, taxonomic
               classification, and functional annotation on shotgun data,
               supporting user-built dictionaries to transfer annotations to any
               functional identifier. MEDUSA includes several tools, as fastp,
               Bowtie2, DIAMOND, Kaiju, MEGAHIT, and a novel tool implemented in
               Python to transfer annotations to BLAST/DIAMOND alignment
               results. These tools are installed via Conda, and the workflow is
               managed by Snakemake, easing the setup and execution. Compared
               with MEGAN 6 Community Edition, MEDUSA correctly identifies more
               species, especially the less abundant, and is more suited for
               functional analysis using Gene Ontology identifiers.},

               verifiable method for comprehensive microbiome analysis of
               fungal, viral, archaeal and bacterial taxonomy, particularly with
               regard to visualization of read mapping location, normalization
               options, growth dynamics and functional gene repertoires. Current
               read classification tools use non-standard output formats, or do
               not fully show information on mapping location. As reference
               datasets are not perfect, portrayal of mapping information is
               critical for judging results effectively. RESULTS: Our
               alignment-based pipeline, Wochenende, incorporates flexible
               quality control, trimming, mapping, various filters and
               normalization. Results are completely transparent and filters can
               be adjusted by the user. We observe stringent filtering of
               mismatches and use of mapping quality sharply reduces the number
               of false positives. Further modules allow genomic visualization
               and the calculation of growth rates, as well as integration and
               subsequent plotting of pipeline results as heatmaps or heat
               trees. Our novel normalization approach additionally allows
               calculation of absolute abundance profiles by comparison with
               reads assigned to the human host genome. CONCLUSION: Wochenende
               has the ability to find and filter alignments to all kingdoms of
               life using both short and long reads, and requires only good
               quality reference genomes. Wochenende automatically combines
               multiple available modules ranging from quality control and
               normalization to taxonomic visualization. Wochenende is available

              ancient environments, lifestyles and disease spread in the past.
              However, high error rates have been a long-standing challenge in
              ancient metagenomics analysis. This is also complicated by a
              limited choice of ancient microbiome specific computational
              frameworks that meet the growing computational demands of the
              field. Here, we propose aMeta, an accurate ancient Metagenomic
              profiling workflow designed primarily to minimize the amount of
              false discoveries and computer memory requirements. Using
              simulated ancient metagenomic samples, we benchmark aMeta against
              a current state-of-the-art workflow, and demonstrate its superior
              sensitivity and specificity in both microbial detection and
              authentication, as well as substantially lower usage of computer
              memory. aMeta is implemented as a Snakemake workflow to facilitate
