              single-celled eukaryotes have crucial roles in the environment and
              in human health. However, microbes are frequently difficult to
              culture in the laboratory, which can confound cataloging of
              members and understanding of how communities function.
              High-throughput sequencing technologies and a suite of
              computational pipelines have been combined into shotgun
              metagenomics methods that have transformed microbiology. Still,
              computational approaches to overcome the challenges that affect
              both assembly-based and mapping-based metagenomic profiling,
              particularly of high-complexity samples or environments containing
              organisms with limited similarity to sequenced genomes, are
              needed. Understanding the functions and characterizing specific
              strains of these communities offers biotechnological promise in

  abstract = "Although microbial communities are associated with human,
              environmental, plant, and animal health, there exists no
              cost-effective method for precisely characterizing species and
              genes in such communities. While deep whole-metagenome shotgun
              (WMS) sequencing provides high taxonomic and functional
              resolution, it is often prohibitively expensive for large-scale
              studies. The prevailing alternative, 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S)
              sequencing, often does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level
              and provides only moderately accurate predictions of the
              functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted
              approach to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic, and functional
              microbiome analysis. To address this technology gap, we evaluated
              the information content of shallow shotgun sequencing with as low
              as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an alternative to 16S
              sequencing for large human microbiome studies. We describe a
              library preparation protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing
              at approximately the same per-sample cost as 16S sequencing. We
              analyzed multiple real and simulated biological data sets,
              including two novel human stool samples with ultradeep sequencing
              of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, and found that shallow
              shotgun sequencing recovers more-accurate species-level taxonomic
              and functional profiles of the human microbiome than 16S
              sequencing. We discuss the inherent limitations of shallow shotgun
              sequencing and note that 16S sequencing remains a valuable and
              important method for taxonomic profiling of novel environments.
              Although deep WMS sequencing remains the gold standard for
              high-resolution microbiome analysis, we recommend that researchers
              consider shallow shotgun sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S
              sequencing for large-scale human microbiome research studies where
              WMS sequencing may be cost-prohibitive. IMPORTANCE A common
              refrain in recent microbiome-related academic meetings is that the
              field needs to move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S
              sequencing and toward more powerful longitudinal studies using
              shotgun sequencing. However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in
              large longitudinal studies remains prohibitively expensive for all
              but the most well-funded research labs and consortia, which leads
              many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for large studies,
              followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted
              samples. Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun
              sequencing may be used by researchers to obtain species-level
              taxonomic and functional data at approximately the same cost as
              amplicon sequencing. While shallow shotgun sequencing is not
              intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level
              characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists consider
              using shallow shotgun sequencing instead of 16S sequencing for
              large-scale human microbiome studies.",
