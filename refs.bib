              single-celled eukaryotes have crucial roles in the environment and
              in human health. However, microbes are frequently difficult to
              culture in the laboratory, which can confound cataloging of

              High-throughput sequencing technologies and a suite of

              environmental, plant, and animal health, there exists no
              cost-effective method for precisely characterizing species and
              genes in such communities. While deep whole-metagenome shotgun
              (WMS) sequencing provides high taxonomic and functional
              resolution, it is often prohibitively expensive for large-scale
              studies. The prevailing alternative, 16S rRNA gene amplicon (16S)
              sequencing, often does not resolve taxonomy past the genus level
              and provides only moderately accurate predictions of the
              functional profile; thus, there is currently no widely accepted
              approach to affordable, high-resolution, taxonomic, and functional
              microbiome analysis. To address this technology gap, we evaluated
              the information content of shallow shotgun sequencing with as low
              as 0.5 million sequences per sample as an alternative to 16S
              sequencing for large human microbiome studies. We describe a
              library preparation protocol enabling shallow shotgun sequencing
              at approximately the same per-sample cost as 16S sequencing. We
              analyzed multiple real and simulated biological data sets,
              including two novel human stool samples with ultradeep sequencing
              of 2.5 billion sequences per sample, and found that shallow
              shotgun sequencing recovers more-accurate species-level taxonomic
              and functional profiles of the human microbiome than 16S
              sequencing. We discuss the inherent limitations of shallow shotgun
              sequencing and note that 16S sequencing remains a valuable and
              important method for taxonomic profiling of novel environments.
              Although deep WMS sequencing remains the gold standard for
              high-resolution microbiome analysis, we recommend that researchers
              consider shallow shotgun sequencing as a useful alternative to 16S
              sequencing for large-scale human microbiome research studies where
              WMS sequencing may be cost-prohibitive. IMPORTANCE A common
              refrain in recent microbiome-related academic meetings is that the
              field needs to move away from broad taxonomic surveys using 16S
              sequencing and toward more powerful longitudinal studies using
              shotgun sequencing. However, performing deep shotgun sequencing in
              large longitudinal studies remains prohibitively expensive for all
              but the most well-funded research labs and consortia, which leads
              many researchers to choose 16S sequencing for large studies,
              followed by deep shotgun sequencing on a subset of targeted
              samples. Here, we show that shallow- or moderate-depth shotgun
              sequencing may be used by researchers to obtain species-level
              taxonomic and functional data at approximately the same cost as
              amplicon sequencing. While shallow shotgun sequencing is not
              intended to replace deep shotgun sequencing for strain-level
              characterization, we recommend that microbiome scientists consider
              using shallow shotgun sequencing instead of 16S sequencing for
              large-scale human microbiome studies.",

              Through the introduction of a new metagenomic analysis tool called

              While recent taxonomic classification programs achieve high speed
              by comparing genomic k-mers, they often lack sensitivity for
              overcoming evolutionary divergence, so that large fractions of the

              metagenome classifier Kaiju, which finds maximum (in-)exact
              matches on the protein-level using the Burrows-Wheeler transform.
              We show in a genome exclusion benchmark that Kaiju classifies
              reads with higher sensitivity and similar precision compared with
              current k-mer-based classifiers, especially in genera that are
              underrepresented in reference databases. We also demonstrate that

              abundance of microorganisms in biological samples. Available
              methods using shotgun metagenomic data generally depend on the
              deposition of sequenced and taxonomically annotated genomes,
              usually from cultures of isolated strains, in reference databases
              (reference genomes). However, the majority of microorganisms have
              not been cultured yet. Thus, a substantial fraction of microbial
              community members remains unaccounted for during taxonomic
              profiling, particularly in samples from underexplored
              environments. To address this issue, we developed the mOTU
              profiler, a tool that enables reference genome-independent
              species-level profiling of metagenomes. As such, it supports the
              identification and quantification of both ``known'' and
              ``unknown'' species based on a set of select marker genes.
              RESULTS: We present mOTUs3, a command line tool that enables the
              profiling of metagenomes for >33,000 species-level operational
              taxonomic units. To achieve this, we leveraged the reconstruction
              of >600,000 draft genomes, most of which are metagenome-assembled
              genomes (MAGs), from diverse microbiomes, including soil,
              freshwater systems, and the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants
              and other animals, which we found to be underrepresented by
              reference genomes. Overall, two thirds of all species-level taxa
              lacked a reference genome. The cumulative relative abundance of
              these newly included taxa was low in well-studied microbiomes,
              such as the human body sites (6-11\%). By contrast, they accounted
              for substantial proportions (ocean, freshwater, soil: 43-63\%) or
              even the majority (pig, fish, cattle: 60-80\%) of the relative
              abundance across diverse non-human-associated microbiomes. Using
              community-developed benchmarks and datasets, we found mOTUs3 to be
              more accurate than other methods and to be more congruent with 16S
              rRNA gene-based methods for taxonomic profiling. Furthermore, we

              profiling of metagenomes. Compared to other methods, it provides a
              more comprehensive view of prokaryotic community diversity, in
              particular for currently underexplored microbiomes. To facilitate
              comparative analyses by the research community, it is released
              with >11,000 precomputed profiles for publicly available
              metagenomes and is freely available at:

               greatly benefits metagenomics studies. However, currently
               available methods struggle to manage the increasing amount of
               sequences and their frequent updates. Indexing the current RefSeq
               can take days and hundreds of GB of memory on large servers. Few
               methods address these issues thus far, and even though many can
               theoretically handle large amounts of references, time/memory
               requirements are prohibitive in practice. As a result, many
               studies that require sequence classification use often outdated
               and almost never truly up-to-date indices. RESULTS: Motivated by
               those limitations, we created ganon, a k-mer-based read
               classification tool that uses Interleaved Bloom Filters in
               conjunction with a taxonomic clustering and a k-mer
               counting/filtering scheme. Ganon provides an efficient method for
               indexing references, keeping them updated. It requires <55 min to
               index the complete RefSeq of bacteria, archaea, fungi and
               viruses. The tool can further keep these indices up-to-date in a
               fraction of the time necessary to create them. Ganon makes it
               possible to query against very large reference sets and therefore
               it classifies significantly more reads and identifies more
               species than similar methods. When classifying a high-complexity
               CAMI challenge dataset against complete genomes from RefSeq,
               ganon shows strongly increased precision with equal or better
               sensitivity compared with state-of-the-art tools. With the same
               dataset against the complete RefSeq, ganon improved the F1-score
               by 65\% at the genus level. It supports taxonomy- and
               assembly-level classification, multiple indices and hierarchical
               classification. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The software is

               enables the improvement of metagenomic profiling accuracy but
               also imposes greater requirements on the indexing efficiency,
               database size and runtime of taxonomic profilers. Additionally,
               most profilers focus mainly on bacterial, archaeal and fungal
               populations, while less attention is paid to viral communities.
               RESULTS: We present KMCP (K-mer-based Metagenomic Classification
               and Profiling), a novel k-mer-based metagenomic profiling tool
               that utilizes genome coverage information by splitting the
               reference genomes into chunks and stores k-mers in a modified and
               optimized Compact Bit-Sliced Signature Index for fast
               alignment-free sequence searching. KMCP combines k-mer similarity
               and genome coverage information to reduce the false positive rate
               of k-mer-based taxonomic classification and profiling methods.
               Benchmarking results based on simulated and real data demonstrate
               that KMCP, despite a longer running time than all other methods,
               not only allows the accurate taxonomic profiling of prokaryotic
               and viral populations but also provides more confident pathogen
