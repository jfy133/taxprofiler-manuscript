## Abstract

Metagenomic classification tackles the problem of characterising the taxonomic source of all DNA sequencing reads in a sample. A common approach to address the differences and biases between the many different taxonomic classification tools is to run sequencing libraries through multiple classification tools and databases. This, however, is a very time intensive task when performing manually - particularly when combined with the appropriate preprocessing of sequencing reads before the classification. 

Here we present nf-core/taxprofiler, a highly parallelised taxonomic classification and processing pipeline that allows for automated and simultaneous classification and/or profiling of of both short- and long-read metagenomic sequencing libraries against a large number of taxonomic classifiers and profilers as well as databases in one pipeline run. Implemented in Nextflow and nf-core, the pipeline benefits from high levels of scalability and portability, allowing for large and small profjects on a wide range of computing infrastructure, as well as best-practise software development and community support to ensure longevity and adaptability of the pipeline as the field of metageomics develops. <...>

## Introduction


While there are strong benefits of metagenomic approaches to taxonomic classification versus targeted approaches, the problem remains challenging and without clear gold standard tools or techniques.
