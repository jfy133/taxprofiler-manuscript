Implemented in Nextflow and nf-core, the pipeline benefits from high levels of scalability and portability, allowing for large and small projects on a wide range of computing infrastructure, as well as best-practise software development and community support to ensure longevity and adaptability of the pipeline as the field of metagenomics develops. &lt;…&gt;"

    "text": "Introduction\nThere are a range of strong benefits of metagenomic approaches to taxonomic classification of DNA samples compared to targeted approaches. While targeted approaches such as 16S or other marker gene amplicon sequencing have in the past been useful due to low cost and large reference databases, shotgun sequencing coupled with metagenomic analyses is being shown to produce similar resolution during taxonomic classification at increasingly lower costs (Hillmann et al. 2018), and additionally with the data having greater use in terms of reusability and further exploration (given whole genomes and thus functional information can be characterised).\n&lt;…&gt; define classification and profiling\nIt is a popular problem &lt;…&gt; however there is no established ‘gold standard’ method,. Therefore there are a plethora of tools and databases tackling the problem of taxonomic classification and/or profiling, yet &lt;…&gt;"

Output from all classifiers and profilers are additionally standardised into a common taxon table format and some with visualisation of profiles.\n\n\nThere are many types of metagenomic profile techniques from alignment, to k-mer, and marker-gene based methods (Quince et al. 2017)"
