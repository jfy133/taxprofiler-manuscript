    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThere are a range of strong benefits of metagenomic approaches to taxonomic classification of DNA samples compared to targeted approaches [CITE]. While targeted approaches such as 16S or other marker gene amplicon sequencing have in the past been useful due to low cost and large and diverse reference databases, metagenomic analyses has been shown to produce similar resolution during taxonomic classification (Hillmann et al. 2018) (with increasing lower costs of shotgun sequencing), but the added benefit of having greater reusability potential of the data, via whole genome reconstruction and also functional classification of metagenomics.\n\nTaxonomic profiling consists of identifying the original ‘taxonomic source’ of a given DNA sequence [CITE]. In metagenomics this typically consists of comparing millions of DNA sequences against hundreds or thousands of reference genomes either via alignment or ‘k-mer matching’ [CITE], and the most close match being considered the most likely original ‘source’ organism of that sequence. Some profilers additionally will also try to infer actual (cellular) species abundance of the organism in the original sample, based on the sequence abundance [CITE].\nDue to the scale of the problem, taxonomic profiling remains an ‘unresolved problem’ in bioinformatics. Having to identify the original source of many sequences, against many reference genomes but in an efficient manner is understandably a difficult problem. Therefore a plethora of tools have been developed to address this challenge, all with their own biases and specific contexts that they have been developed in (Sczyrba et al. 2017; Meyer et al. 2022). Additionally, each tool often produces tool-specific output formats making it difficult to efficiently cross compare results. Thus, no established ‘gold standard’ method currently exists.\nOne solution to addressing the range of different tools is to run all of them in parallel, and cross compare the results. This can both be useful for benchmarking studies (e.g. Sczyrba et al. 2017; Meyer et al. 2022), but also to build consensus profiles whereby confidence of a particular taxonomic identification can be increased when it is detected by multiple tools [CITE].\nA second challenge in taxonomic profiling is a question of databases. As with tools, there is no one set ‘gold standard’ database for taxonomic profiling. Different questions and contexts may require different databases, such as when a researcher wants to search for both bacteria_and viruses species in samples, and as an extension of this, classifiers may need different settings for each database. Furthermore, as genomic sequencing becomes cheaper and more efficient, the number of publicly available reference genomes are rapidly increasing [CITE], making the size of databases taxonomic classifiers also much a larger.\nFinally, with the sinking of sequencing costs, this opens up the possibility for larger and larger metagenome sequencing, meaning the sample sizes of studies are increasing further highlighting the need for methods for efficiently profiling many samples against many tools and databases. Manually setting up bioinformatic jobs for classification tasks for each database and settings against different tools on traditional academic computing infrastructure (e.g. high performance computing clusters or ‘HPC’ clusters) can be very tedious. Additionally, particularly for very large sample sets, there is increasing use of cloud platforms that have greater scalability than traditional HPCs. Being able to reliably and reproducibly execute taxonomic classification tasks across infrastructure with minimal intervention would therefore be a boon for the metagenomics field.\nHere we present nf-core/taxprofiler a pipeline designed to allow users to efficiently and simultaneously taxonomically classify and profile short- and long-read sequencing data against multiple tools and databases in a single pipeline run. nf-core/taxprofiler utilises Nextflow (Di Tommaso et al. 2017) to ensure efficiency, portability, and scalability, and has been developed within the nf-core initiative of Nextflow pipelines (Ewels et al. 2020) to ensure high quality coding practises and user accessibility, including detailed documentation and a GUI execution interface."

    "section": "Implementation",
    "text": "Implementation\nnf-core/taxprofiler aims to facilitate three main steps of a typical shotgun metagenomic workflow. Taking in short- (e.g. Illumina) or long-read (e.g. Nanopore) FASTQ or FASTA files, it can perform a range of appropriate preprocessing steps of reads, then perform taxonomic classification profiling against a range of different tools depending on the wish of the user, and finally perform post-classification aggregation and standardisation of the resulting profiles with the possibility of visualisation of outputs [FIGURE 1]. All relevant preprocessing statistics are displayed in an interactive and dynamic MultiQC report [CITE].\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visual overview of the nf-core/taxprofiler workflow. nf-core/taxprofiler can take in FASTQ (short or long reads) or FASTA files (long reads), that will optionally go through sequencing quality control, read preprocessing, complexity filtering, host removal, and run merging before going into taxonomic classification and/or profiling with a user-selected range of tools and databases. Output from all classifiers and profilers are additionally standardised into a common taxon table format and some with visualisation of profiles.\n\n\n\nInput and Execution\n\n\n\n\nPreprocessing\nPreprocessing steps in nf-core/taxprofiler are aimed at removing laboratory and sequencing artefacts that may influence taxonomically profiling, either for computing resource consumption and/or false-positive or false-negative classification reasons. First sequencing quality control with FastQC [CITE] or Falco [CITE] is carried out. Falco was included in for reduced memory requirements in particular for long reads sequencing. Library adapter sequences can reduce accuracy during alignment and are sometimes contaminants inside reference genomes [CITE CARP BLOG], and paired-end merging may provide longer sequences that will allow more specific classification when paired-end alignment is not supported by a given classifier. For these tasks nf-core/taxprofiler can apply either fastp [CITE] or AdapterRemoval2 [CITE] for short-reads, and Porechop [CITE] for Oxford Nanopore long-read data. For both short- and long-reads FastQC or Falco is run again to allow assessment on the performance of the adapter removal and/or pair-merging step.\nLow complexity sequences, e.g. sequences containing long stretches mono- or di-nucleotide repeats provide little specific genetic information that contribute to taxonomic identification, as they can align to many different reference genomes. Including such reads during profiling can increase run-time and memory usage for little gain, as during lowest-common-ancestor (LCA) classification steps they will be assigned to high-level taxonomic levels such as Kingdom. nf-core/taxprofiler offers removal of these reads through complexity filtering algorithms as provided by fastp, BBDuk [CITE], or PRINSEQ++ [CITE]. Long read sequences often do not have such reads as lengths are sufficeint enough to capture greater sequence diversity - but it is sometimes desired to only classify reads longer than a certain length - as these provide sufficient taxonomic information. Therefore nf-core/taxprofiler can remove contigs shorter than a user-defined length using Filtlong.\nAnother common preprocessing step in metagenomic studies is to remove possible host DNA. This can help speed up run-time, particularly for microbiome studies, where detection of only microbes are of interest. Furthermore, host-contamination of reference genomes on public databases is common [CITE], therefore removal of such sequences can also decrease the risk of false positive taxonomic identifications. If users wish to remove multiple hosts or other sequences, they can simply combine all reference genomes into a single FASTA reference file. Short-read host removal can be carried out with Bowtie2 [CITE] and minimap2 for long-reads, both in combination with SAMtools [CITE].\nFinally, nf-core/taxprofiler can optionally perform run merging where libraries have been sequenced over multiple lanes to generate one profile per sample or library.\nAcross all steps, relevant statistics and log files are generated, and the processed reads of each step in FASTQ format can be optionally saved for downstream re-use.\n\n\nProfiling\nThere are many types of metagenomic profile techniques from profiling against whole-genome references with alignment or k-mer based approaches [CITE], or methods involving alignment to species-specific marker-gene families (Quince et al. 2017,OTHERS?). nf-core/taxprofiler aims to support and include all established classification or profiling tools as requested by the community. Which tools are used in a pipeline run is up to the user, with a tool being executed both a corresponding database and --run_&lt;tool&gt; flag is provided. Specific classification/profiling settings for each tool and database are specified in the database CSV input sheet, however for some tools pipeline level command-line flags are available.\nAs of version 1.1.0, the following classifiers and profilers are available: Kraken2 [CITE], Bracken [CITE], KrakenUniq [CITE], Centrifuge [CITE], MALT [CITE], DIAMOND [CITE], Kaiju [CITE], MetaPhlAn3 [CITE], MetaPhlAn4 [CITE] mOTUs [CITE], ganon [CITE], KMCP [CITE]. Table  summarises the category and reference database type for each tool.\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nReference Type\nTool\n\n\n\n\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nKraken2\n\n\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nBracken\n\n\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nKrakenUniq\n\n\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nganon\n\n\n???\n???\nKMCP\n\n\nalignment based\nwhole-genome\nCentrifuge\n\n\nalignment based\nwhole-genome\nMALT\n\n\nalignment based\nwhole-genome\nDIAMOND\n\n\nalignment based\nwhole-genome\nKaiju\n\n\nalignment based\nmarker-gene\nMetaPhlAn3\n\n\nalignment based\nmarker-gene\nMetaPhlAn4\n\n\nalignment based\nmarker-gene\nmOTUS\n\n\n\nnf-core/taxprofiler by default produces the per-sample main taxonomic classification profile from a tool or a tool’s report generation tool, normally in the form of counts per reference sequencing, with additional statistics about the hits of a particular organism (estimated abundance, taxonomic level etc.). Users can also optionally request output of per-read classification output, and output such as classified and unclassified reads in FASTQ format, where supported.\n\n\nPost-profiling\nMetagenomic studies often must compare the profiles between many samples, and the results of multiple profiles are normally stored in ‘taxon tables’, i.e, counts per reference (rows), for each sample (columns). When available nf-core/taxprofiler can optionally produce the ‘native’ taxon table of each classification tool when multiple samples are run.\nWhen researchers wish to compare between taxonomic classifiers or profilers, they must often deal with the heterogenous output formats that are produced by each tool, typically in the form of custom parser and merging scripts for each tool. To facilitate more user-friendly cross-comparison between tools, nf-core/taxprofiler utilises the TAXPASTA tool (Beber?) to generate standardarised profiles and generate multi-sample tables.\nSummary statistics for the entire pipeline are visualised are displayed in a customisable MultiQC report [CITE], when supported, to support user quality control of data and pipeline runs. Krona plots [CITE] can also optionally be generated for supported tools to help provide further visualisation of taxonomic profiles."
