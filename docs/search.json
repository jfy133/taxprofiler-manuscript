    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nThere are a range of strong benefits of metagenomic approaches to taxonomic classification of DNA samples compared to targeted approaches [CITE]. While targeted approaches such as 16S or other marker gene amplicon sequencing have in the past been useful due to low cost and large and diverse reference databases, metagenomic analyses has been shown to produce similar resolution during taxonomic classification (Hillmann et al. 2018) (with increasing lower costs of shotgun sequencing), but the added benefit of having greater reusability potential of the data, via whole genome reconstruction and also functional classification of metagenomics.\n\nTaxonomic profiling consists of identifying the original ‘taxonomic source’ of a given DNA sequence [CITE]. In metagenomics this typically consists of comparing millions of DNA sequences against hundreds or thousands of reference genomes either via alignment or ‘k-mer matching’ [CITE], and the most close match being considered the most likely original ‘source’ organism of that sequence. Some profilers additionally will also try to infer actual (cellular) species abundance of the organism in the original sample, based on the sequence abundance [CITE].\nDue to the scale of taxonomic profiling is an unresolved ‘problem’ in bioinformatics. Having to identify the original source of many sequences, from many samples, against many reference genomes but in an efficient manner is understandably a difficult problem. Therefore a plethora of tools have been developed to address this challenge, all with their own biases and specific contexts they have been developed in (Sczyrba et al. 2017; Meyer et al. 2022). Thus, no established ‘gold standard’ method currently exists."

Output from all classifiers and profilers are additionally standardised into a common taxon table format and some with visualisation of profiles.\n\n\nThere are many types of metagenomic profile techniques from alignment, to k-mer, and marker-gene based methods (Quince et al. 2017)"
