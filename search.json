    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nShotgun metagenomics offers strong benefits to the taxonomic classification of DNA samples over targeted approaches (Eloe-Fadrosh et al. 2016; Florian P. Breitwieser, Lu, and Salzberg 2019). While metabarcoding approaches targeting the 16S rRNA or other marker genes are widely due to low cost and large, diverse reference databases (Yilmaz et al. 2014; Lynch and Neufeld 2015), metagenomic approaches have been gaining popularity with the increasingly lower costs of shotgun sequencing. These metagenomic analyses have been shown to provide similar resolution on microbial genomes during taxonomic classification (Hillmann et al. 2018), with the added benefit of having greater reusability potential of the data, via whole genome reconstruction and also functional classification of metagenomics (Sharpton 2014; Quince et al. 2017).\nTaxonomic classifiers (sometimes referred to as taxonomic binners) consists of identifying the original ‘taxonomic source’ of a given DNA sequence (Ye et al. 2019; Meyer et al. 2022; Govender and Eyre 2022). In metagenomics this typically consists of comparing millions of DNA sequences against hundreds or thousands of reference genomes either via alignment or ‘k-mer matching’ (Sharpton 2014; Sun et al. 2021), with the most close match being considered the most likely original ‘source’ organism of that sequence. Taxonomic profilers additionally will also try to infer species abundance of the organism in the original sample, based on the sequence abundance (Nayfach and Pollard 2016). We will use classifiers and profilers interchangeably throughout the this publication.\nDue to the scale of the problem, taxonomic profiling remains an ‘unresolved problem’ in bioinformatics. Having to identify the original source of many sequences, against many reference genomes but in an efficient manner is understandably a difficult problem. Therefore a plethora of tools have been developed to address this challenge, all with their own biases and specific contexts that they have been developed in (Sczyrba et al. 2017; Meyer et al. 2022). Additionally, each tool often produces tool-specific output formats making it difficult to efficiently cross compare results. Thus, no established ‘gold standard’ method currently exists.\nOne solution to address the range of different tools is to run all of them in parallel, and cross compare the results. This can be useful both for benchmarking studies (e.g. Sczyrba et al. 2017; Meyer et al. 2022), but also to build consensus profiles whereby confidence of a particular taxonomic identification can be increased when it is detected by multiple tools (McIntyre et al. 2017; Ye et al. 2019).\nA second challenge in taxonomic classification is a question of databases. As with tools, there is no one set ‘gold standard’ database. Different questions and contexts may require different databases, such as when a researcher wants to search for both bacteria and viruses species in samples, and as an extension of this, taxonomic classifiers may need different settings for each database. Furthermore, as genomic sequencing becomes cheaper and more efficient, the number of publicly available reference genomes are rapidly increasing (Nasko et al. 2018), making the size of databases taxonomic classifiers also a much larger and often outpacing the computational capacity available to researchers. In fact, while this was one of the main motivations behind classifiers such as Kraken2 (Wood, Lu, and Langmead 2019), these algorithmic techniques are already becoming insufficient (Wright, Comeau, and Langille 2023).\nFinally, with the decrease of costs, this possibility for larger and larger metagenome sequencing datasets increases, meaning the sample sizes of studies are increasing, as exemplified by the doubling of the number of metagenomes on the European Bioinformatic Institute’s MGnify database in two years (Mitchell et al. 2019). Altogether this highlights the need for methods to efficiently profile many samples using many tools. Manually setting up bioinformatic jobs for classification tasks for each database and settings against different tools on traditional academic computing infrastructure (e.g. high performance computing clusters or ‘HPC’ clusters) can be very tedious. Additionally, particularly for very large sample sets, there is increasing use of cloud platforms that have greater scalability than traditional HPCs. Being able to reliably and reproducibly execute taxonomic classification tasks across infrastructure with minimal intervention would therefore be a boon for the metagenomics field.\nHere we present nf-core/taxprofiler, a pipeline designed to allow users to efficiently and simultaneously taxonomically classify and profile short- and long-read sequencing data against multiple tools and databases in a single pipeline run. nf-core/taxprofiler utilises Nextflow (Di Tommaso et al. 2017) to ensure efficiency, portability, and scalability, and has been developed within the nf-core initiative of Nextflow pipelines (Ewels et al. 2020) to ensure high quality coding practises and user accessibility, including detailed documentation and a graphical-user-interface (GUI) execution interface."

    "section": "Implementation",
    "text": "Implementation\nnf-core/taxprofiler aims to facilitate three main steps of a typical shotgun metagenomic workflow (Chiu and Miller 2019). Taking in short- (e.g. Illumina) or long-read (e.g. Nanopore) FASTQ or FASTA files, it can (1) perform a range of appropriate read preprocessing steps, (2) perform taxonomic classification and profiling against a range of different tools depending on user preferences, and finally (3) perform post-classification aggregation and standardisation of the resulting profiles with the possibility of visualisation to the outputs (Figure 1). All relevant preprocessing statistics are displayed in an interactive and dynamic MultiQC report (Ewels et al. 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visual overview of the nf-core/taxprofiler workflow. nf-core/taxprofiler can take in FASTQ (short or long reads) or FASTA files (long reads), that will optionally go through sequencing quality control (e.g. with FastQC), read preprocessing (e.g. removal of adapters), complexity filtering, host removal, and run merging before performing taxonomic classification and/or profiling with a user-selected range of tools and databases. Output from all classifiers and profilers are standardised into a common taxon table format, and when supported visualisations of the profiles are generated.\n\n\n\nInput and Execution\nThe pipeline can be executed via typical Nextflow commands, or using the standard nf-core ‘launch’ GUI (https://nf-co.re/taxprofiler/launch), making the pipeline accessible for both computationally experienced as well as less experienced researchers. In addition to the general usage and parameter documentation of the pipeline (https://nf-co.re/taxprofiler). The GUI offers immediate assistance and guidance to users on what each parameter does, both in short- and long-form, with long-form parameter descriptions additionally describing which tool-specific parameter(s) are being modified for each pipeline parameter (Figure 2). The GUI also includes controlled user input by providing strict drop-down lists and input validation prior execution of the pipeline to reduce the risk of typos and other mistakes (in contrast the command-line interface (CLI) that only includes validation at pipeline run-time).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of the nf-core pipeline launch graphical user interface with nf-core/taxprofiler options displayed. The web browser-based interface provides guidance for how to configure each pipeline parameter by providing both short and long help descriptions to help guide users in which contexts to configure each parameter. Additional elements such as radio buttons, drop down menus, and background regular expressions check for validity of input. When pressing launch, a prepared configuration file and command is provided that can be copied and pasted by the user into the terminal\n\n\nAn example nf-core command line execution of the pipeline can be seen in figure (Code Block 1), where two input files are supplied: one file specifying paths of FASTQ files of metagenomic samples and necessary metadata for preprocessing (such as sample ID and sequencing platform), and the second file specifying paths to the user-defined databases with per-database classification parameters. Various parameters are available to optionally turn on different preprocessing steps, and provide additional configurations such as tool selection and value options. Note that even if a user supplies a given database in the database input sheet, the corresponding profiling tool must still be activated with the corresponding pipeline parameter (e.g. --run_kraken2). Per-classifier flags are also available for the optional saving of additional non-profile output files.\n\nListing 1: Example nf-core/taxprofiler command for running short-read quality control, removal of host DNA and executing the k-mer based Kraken2 and marker gene alignment MetaPhlAn3 tools.\n$ nextflow run nf-core/taxprofiler -r 1.1.0 \\\n-profile singularity,&lt;institute&gt; \\\n--input &lt;samplesheet.csv&gt; --databases &lt;database.csv&gt; \\\n--perform_shortread_qc  --shortread_qc_minlength 20 --preprocessing_qc_tool falco \\\n--run_host_removal --hostremoval_reference 'host_genome.fasta' \\\n--run_kraken2 --kraken2_save_reads \\\n--run_metaphlan3 \\\n--run_krona \\\n--run_profile_standardisation \\\n\nAll nf-core pipelines are strictly versioned (specified with the Nextflow -r flag), and to ensure reproducibility, each version of the pipeline has a fixed set of software used for each step of the pipeline. The fixed set of software are controlled through the use of the conda package manager and containers (e.g., docker, singularity) from the stable Bioconda (Grüning et al. 2018) and BioContainers (Veiga Leprevost et al. 2017) repositories. This, coupled with the intrinsic Nextflow ability to execute on most infrastructure whether that is a local laptop (resource requirements permitting), traditional HPC, as well across common cloud providers also makes nf-core/taxprofiler a very portable pipeline that can be used across many contexts.\n\n\nPreprocessing\nPreprocessing steps in nf-core/taxprofiler are aimed at removing laboratory and sequencing artefacts that may influence taxonomically profiling, either for computing resource consumption and/or false-positive or false-negative classification reasons. First sequencing quality control with FastQC (Andrews 2010) or Falco (Sena Brandine and Smith 2021) is carried out. Falco was included in for reduced memory requirements, in particular for long reads sequencing. Artificial library adapter sequences added during sequencing reduces accuracy during alignment by reducing sequence specificity, and in some cases, may result in false-positive hits due to adapter sequence contamination in reference genomes (Schäffer et al. 2018; F. P. Breitwieser, Baker, and Salzberg 2018) 1. Additionally, the paired-end merging may provide longer sequences that will allow more specific classification when paired-end alignment is not supported by a given classifier. For these tasks nf-core/taxprofiler can apply either fastp (Chen et al. 2018) or AdapterRemoval2 (Schubert, Lindgreen, and Orlando 2016) for short-reads, and currently Porechop (Wick et al. 2017) for Oxford Nanopore long-read data. For both short- and long-reads FastQC or Falco is run again to allow assessment on the performance of the adapter removal and/or pair-merging step.\nLow complexity sequences, e.g. sequences containing long stretches mono- or di-nucleotide repeats provide little specific genetic information that contribute to taxonomic identification, as they can align to many different reference genomes (Schmieder and Edwards 2011; Clarke et al. 2019). Including such reads during taxonomic profiling can increase run-time and memory usage for little gain, as during lowest-common-ancestor (LCA) classification steps they will be assigned to high-level taxonomic levels (e.g. Kingdom). nf-core/taxprofiler performs removal of these reads through complexity filtering algorithms as provided by fastp, BBDuk (Bushnell 2022), or PRINSEQ++ (Cantu, Sadural, and Edwards 2019). Long read sequences often do not have such reads as lengths are sufficient enough to capture greater sequence diversity - but it is sometimes desired to only classify reads longer than a certain length - as these provide more precise taxonomic information (Dilthey et al. 2019; Portik, Brown, and Pierce-Ward 2022). Therefore, nf-core/taxprofiler can remove reads shorter than a user-defined length using Filtlong.\nRemoving host DNA is another common preprocessing step in metagenomic studies. This can help speed up run-time, particularly in microbiome studies, where detection of microbes are of interest. Furthermore, host-contamination of reference genomes in public databases is common (Longo, O’Neill, and O’Neill 2011; Kryukov and Imanishi 2016; Florian P. Breitwieser et al. 2019) and therefore the removal of such sequences can also decrease the risk of false positive taxonomic assignment. To remove multiple hosts or other sequences, all reference genomes can be combined into a single FASTA reference file. Short-read host removal can be carried out with Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012; Langmead et al. 2019) and minimap2 (Li 2018) for long-reads, both in combination with SAMtools (Li et al. 2009; Danecek et al. 2021), where reads are aligned against the reference genome and the off-target (unaligned) reads are then converted back to FASTQ format for classification.\nFinally, nf-core/taxprofiler can optionally perform run merging where libraries have been sequenced over multiple lanes to generate one profile per sample or library. The final set of reads used for profiling can be optionally saved for downstream re-use.\nThroughout all steps, relevant statistics and log files are generated and used both for the final pipeline run report as well as saved into the results directory of the pipeline run for further inspection where necessary.\n\n\nProfiling\nThere are many types of metagenomic profile techniques, from profiling against whole-genome references with alignment or k-mer based approaches, to methods involving alignment to species-specific marker-gene families Ye et al. (2019). nf-core/taxprofiler aims to support and include all established classification or profiling tools as requested by the community. The choice of tools used in a pipeline run is up to the user, with a tool being executed when both the corresponding database and --run_&lt;tool&gt; flag is provided. Specific classification settings for each tool and database are specified in the database CSV input sheet. Some tools also have pipeline level command-line flags for controlling certain aspects of output files.\nAs of version 1.1.0, the following classifiers and profilers are available: Kraken2 (Wood, Lu, and Langmead 2019), Bracken (Lu et al. 2017), KrakenUniq (F. P. Breitwieser, Baker, and Salzberg 2018), Centrifuge (Kim et al. 2016), MALT (Vågene et al. 2018), DIAMOND (Buchfink, Reuter, and Drost 2021), Kaiju (Menzel, Ng, and Krogh 2016), MetaPhlAn (Blanco-Míguez et al. 2023), mOTUs (Ruscheweyh et al. 2022), ganon (Piro et al. 2020), KMCP (Shen et al. 2023). Table 1 summarises the category and reference database type for each tool.\n\n\n\nTable 1: List of nf-core/taxprofiler supported taxonomic classifers profilers as of version 1.1 and their method and support input database types. Sequencing matching type refers to which ‘molecular alphabet’ is primarily used for matching between a query (read) and a reference (genome/gene). Parimary algorithm refers to the algorithm type used for sequencing matching. Reference type refers to the typical sequence type used in database construction of the tool. Method refers to whether the tool performs just read classification (classifier) or additionally abundance estimation (profiler)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence Matching Type\nPrimary Algorithm\nReference Type\nMethod\nTool\n\n\n\n\nNucleotide\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nclassifier\nKraken2\n\n\nAmino Acid\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nclassifier\nKaiju\n\n\nNucleotide\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nprofiler\nBracken\n\n\nNucleotide\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nprofiler\nKrakenUniq\n\n\nNucleotide\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nprofiler\nganon\n\n\nNucleotide\nk-mer based\nwhole-genome\nprofiler\nKMCP\n\n\nNucleotide/Amino Acid\nalignment based\nwhole-genome\nclassifier\nMALT\n\n\nAmino Acid\nalignment based\nwhole-genome\nclassifer\nDIAMOND\n\n\nNucleotide\nalignment based\nwhole-genome\nprofiler\nCentrifuge\n\n\nNucleotide\nalignment based\nmarker-gene\nprofiler\nMetaPhlAn3\n\n\nNucleotide\nalignment based\nmarker-gene\nprofiler\nMetaPhlAn4\n\n\nNucleotide\nalignment based\nmarker-gene\nprofiler\nmOTUS\n\n\n\n\nBy default, nf-core/taxprofiler produces the per-sample main taxonomic classification profile from a tool or a tool’s report generation tool. The output is normally in the form of counts per reference sequencing, with additional statistics about the hits of a particular organism (estimated abundance, taxonomic level etc.). Users can also optionally request output of per-read classification output, and output such as classified and unclassified reads in FASTQ format, where supported.\nThe pipeline provides high efficiency, particularly during the metagenomic classification stage, through the inherant parallalisation provided by Nextflow. While metagenomic classification is comparatively computationally intensive (in terms of memory and execution time; due to a combination of sequencing depth and number of reference genomes), Nextflow automatically optimises the execution order of all the the steps of pipeline, maximising the number parallel running of multiple profilers and/or databases at any one time, as far as the available computational resources allow. For local machines such as laptops or desktops, Nextflow will automatically detect all availble computational sources but this is customisable using custom Nextflow configuration files. For HPC and cloud infrastructure, users typically have to define the computational infrastructural environment the pipeline is being executed on (CPU or memory limitations, queues, instance types etc.). To reduce the time users must take to get the pipeline up and running, nf-core/taxprofiler supports pre-defined centralised generic and pipeline-specific institutional Nextflow configurations as provided by nf-core/configs (https://nf-co.re/configs; more than 90 institutions at the time of writing). However users are still welcome to supply their own custom configuration files, further refining computational limitations or execution specifications.\n\n\nPost-profiling\nIn metagenomic studies, it is common practise to compare the profiles among many samples, and the results of multiple profiles are normally stored in ‘taxon tables’, i.e, counts per reference (rows), for each sample (columns). When available, nf-core/taxprofiler supports the option to produce the ‘native’ taxon table of each classification tool when multiple samples are run.\nOne of the challenges that researchers face when comparing multiple taxonomic classifiers or profilers is the heterogenous output formats that are produced, and often requires custom parser and merging scripts for each tool to standardise. To facilitate more user-friendly cross-comparison between tools, nf-core/taxprofiler utilises the TAXPASTA tool (Beber et al. 2023) to generate standardised profiles and generate multi-sample tables.\nSummary statistics for the entire pipeline are visualised and displayed in a customisable MultiQC report (Ewels et al. 2020), when supported, to support user quality control of data and pipeline runs. Krona plots (Ondov, Bergman, and Phillippy 2011) can also optionally be generated for supported tools to help provide further visualisation of taxonomic profiles.\n\n\nOutput\nTo summarise, the main default output from nf-core/taxprofiler are both classifier ‘native’ and standardised single- and multi-sample taxonomic profiles with counts per-taxon and an interactive MultiQC run report with all run statistics, in addition to the raw log files themselves where available.\nThe MultiQC run report displays statistics and summary visualisations for all steps of the pipeline where possible, lists of versions for all tools of each step of the pipeline, and provides a dynamically-constructed text for the recommendeded ‘methods’ text for reporting how the pipeline was executed (including relevant citations) that users can use in their own publications.\nOptional outputs can include other types of profiles (e.g. per read classification) and in other formats as produced by the tools themselves, as well as raw reads from preprocessing steps and output visualisations from Krona. Nextflow resource usage and trace reports are also by default produced for users to check pipeline performance."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nComparison with other solutions\n\nnf-core/taxprofiler has been specifically developed for the analysis of metagenomic data. While other types of taxonomic profiling data such as 16S amplicon sequencing are well established fields with a range of popular high-quality and best-practise tools pipelines (e.g. (Blanco-Míguez et al. 2023; Schloss et al. 2009)) and databases (DeSantis et al. 2006; Yilmaz et al. 2014), whereas ‘gold standard’ tools and databases for metagenomics remains are much less established - thus the need for highly-multiplexed classification is more desirable for the newer metagenomics methods. Despite this, tools such as METAXA2 (Bengtsson-Palme et al. 2015) that use shotgun sequencing reads to recover 16S sequences from metagenomic samples.\nA range of pipelines already exist for taxonomic profiling, however each have their own particular purpose and abilities. Here we will review some of the functional similarities and differences between such of these pipelines. Some important advantages over existing pipelines and workflows  is that nf-core/taxprofile is portable and easy to install, can be accessible to users not so experienced with command-line by offering a graphical user interface, uses Docker and Singularity containers to ensure reproducibility. In contrast pipelines such as , still require manual install of the tools in their workflow. Many of the current workflows and pipelines available are already use multiple taxonomic classifiers in their implementation and to our knowledge the crucial factor of database choice still remains a challenge. nf-core/taxprofiler partly adresses the challenge of database choice that has been previously reported  by enabling the use many databases in parallel.\n\n\nDevelopment roadmap\nAn important advantage of nf-core/taxprofiler is that it is being developed within the nf-core community (https://nf-co.re), who provides a strong and long term support for the continued community-based development and maintenance of the pipeline. In this framework, we will continue to add additional metagenomic classification and profiling tools as they become established and as requested by the metagenomics community. This also applies to sequencing platforms; nf-core/taxprofiler already supports Nanopore long-read data, however the use of long-read PacBio data for metagenomic data is growing in interest (Portik, Brown, and Pierce-Ward 2022). We are therefore considering adding dedicated preprocessing steps for this type of sequencing data.\nA remaining major challenge for metagenomics researchers is the construction of databases for each profiling tool. Given there still are no ‘gold standard’ databases, and while nf-core/taxprofiler allows the profiling against multiple databases and settings in parallel, currently the pipeline still requires users to construct these manually and to supply to the pipeline. While we feel this is currently a reasonable investment as such databases can be repeatedly re-used, we are exploring the possibility to add including an additional complementary workflow in the pipeline to allow automated database construction of all classification tools, given a set of FASTA reference files.\nFinally, once an overall taxonomic profile is generated, researchers often wish to validate hits through more sensitive and accurate methods such as with read-mapping alignment. The pipeline could be easily extended to have a validation step where, utilising Nextflow’s execution parallelism, the input sequences could be aligned back to the reference genomes of only those species with hits from the taxonomic classification with dedicated accurate short- or long-read aligners. This step could also be particularly useful for researchers in palaeogenomics, where alignment information can be used to authenticate ancient DNA within their samples and in clinical metagenomics to identify potential pathogens at a much finer resolution (e.g. down to strain level)."
