Output from all classifiers and profilers are additionally standardised into a common taxon table format and some with visualisation of profiles.","key":"fig-workflow-diagram"}],"headings":["abstract","introduction","implementation","use-cases","discussion","data-availability","supplementary-data","acknowledgments","funding","references"]}
