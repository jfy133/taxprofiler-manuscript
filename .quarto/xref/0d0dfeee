Sequencing matching type refers to which ‘molecular alphabet’ is primarily used for matching between a query (read) and a reference (genome/gene). Primary algorithm refers to the algorithm type used for sequencing matching. Reference type refers to the typical sequence type used in database construction of the tool.

Output from all classifiers and profilers are standardised into a common taxon table format, and when supported visualisations of the profiles are generated.","key":"fig-workflow-diagram"}]}
