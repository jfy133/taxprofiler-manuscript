While targeted approaches such as 16S or other marker gene amplicon sequencing have in the past been useful due to low cost and large and diverse reference databases, metagenomic analyses has been shown to produce similar resolution during taxonomic classification [@Hillmann2018-ud] (with increasing lower costs of shotgun sequencing), but the added benefit of having greater reusability potential of the data, via whole genome reconstruction and also functional classification of metagenomics.\n\n<!-- TODO: define our classification/profiling terimnology? -->\n\nTaxonomic profiling consists of identifying the original 'taxonomic source' of a given DNA sequence [CITE]. In metagenomics this typically consists of comparing millions of DNA sequences against hundreds or thousands of reference genomes either via alignment or 'k-mer matching' [CITE], and the most close match being considered the most likely original 'source' organism of that sequence. Some profilers additionally will also try to infer actual (cellular) species abundance of the organism in the original sample, based on the sequence abundance [CITE]. \n\nDue to the scale of the problem, taxonomic profiling remains an 'unresolved problem' in bioinformatics. Having to identify the original source of many sequences, against many reference genomes but in an _efficient_ manner is understandably a difficult problem. Therefore a plethora of tools have been developed to address this challenge, all with their own biases and specific contexts that they have been developed in [@Sczyrba2017-ma;@Meyer2022-dg]. Additionally, each tool often produces tool-specific output formats making it difficult to efficiently cross compare results. Thus, no established 'gold standard' method currently exists.\n\nOne solution to addressing the range of different tools is to run all of them in parallel, and cross compare the results. This can both be useful for benchmarking studies [e.g. @Sczyrba2017-ma;@Meyer2022-dg], but also to build consensus profiles whereby confidence of a particular taxonomic identification can be increased when it is detected by multiple tools [CITE].\n\nA second challenge in taxonomic profiling is a question of databases. As with tools, there is no one set 'gold standard' database for taxonomic profiling. Different questions and contexts may require different databases, such as when a researcher wants to search for both bacteria_and viruses species in samples, and as an extension of this, classifiers may need different settings for each database. Furthermore, as genomic sequencing becomes cheaper and more efficient, the number of publicly available reference genomes are rapidly increasing [CITE], making the size of databases taxonomic classifiers also much a larger. \n\nFinally, with the sinking of sequencing costs, this opens up the possibility for larger and larger metagenome sequencing, meaning the sample sizes of studies are increasing further highlighting the need for methods for efficiently profiling many samples against many tools and databases. Manually setting up bioinformatic jobs for classification tasks for each database and settings against different tools on traditional academic computing infrastructure (e.g. high performance computing clusters or 'HPC' clusters) can be very tedious. Additionally, particularly for very large sample sets, there is increasing use of cloud platforms that have greater scalability than traditional HPCs. Being able to reliably and reproducibly execute taxonomic classification tasks across infrastructure with minimal intervention would therefore be a boon for the metagenomics field.\n\nHere we present nf-core/taxprofiler a pipeline designed to allow users to efficiently and simultaneously taxonomically classify and profile short- and long-read sequencing data against multiple tools and databases in a single pipeline run. nf-core/taxprofiler utilises Nextflow [@Di_Tommaso2017-xu] to ensure efficiency, portability, and scalability, and has been developed within the nf-core initiative of Nextflow pipelines [@Ewels2020-vi] to ensure high quality coding practises and user accessibility, including detailed documentation and a GUI execution interface.\n\n## Implementation\n\nnf-core/taxprofiler aims to facilitate three main steps of a typical shotgun metagenomic workflow.
